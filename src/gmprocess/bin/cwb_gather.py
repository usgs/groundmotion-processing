    To obtain CWB strong motion data, create an account on the CWB GDMS-2020 website:

    https://gdmsn.cwb.gov.tw/index.php

    To retrieve strong motion response files:

    Click on the "Data" icon, then click on "Instrument Response". 

     - For "Output Format", choose "RESP file".
     - For "Network", choose "CWBSN".
     - For "Station", check "All Stations".
     - For "Location", choose "*" for all locations.
     - For "Channel", choose "HN?" for all strong motion stations.
     - For "Start Time (UTC)", enter a date before the event of interest.
     - For "End Time (UTC)", enter a date after the event of interest.
     - For "Label", enter any string that is descriptive to you.

     Click the "Submit" button, and you should see a "Success!" pop up.
     Next will be a screen showing a list of all of your downloads. Response data
     links should appear fairly quickly - click on the name of the generated gzipped
     "tarball" file to download it.

    To retrieve a strong motion data file:

    Click on the "Data" icon, then click on "Multi-Station Waveform Data". 

     - For "Output Format", choose "MiniSEED".
     - For "Network", choose "CWBSN".
     - For "Station", check "All Stations".
     - For "Location", choose "*" for all locations.
     - For "Channel", choose "HN?" for all strong motion stations.
     - For "Start Time (UTC)", enter a time 30 seconds before the origin time of 
       interest.
     - For "End Time (UTC)", enter a time 7 minutes after the origin time of interest.
     - For "Label", enter any string that is descriptive to you.

     Click the "Submit" button, and you should see a "Success!" pop up.
     Next will be a screen showing a list of all of your downloads. Data
