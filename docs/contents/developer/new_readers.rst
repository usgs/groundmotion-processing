Adding New Data Readers
=======================

Most of the difficulty in writing data file readers for the various formats
supported by *gmprocess* comes in handling the various types of headers and
inconsistencies in adherence to the various standards. Here we'll be removing
those from the equation and presenting a semi-idealized data format and some
code to read it.

**The Format**

.. code-block:: 

   Source: Complete Strong Motion Network
   Network: CS
   Station: ABCD
   Station Latitude: 32.443343
   Station Longitude: -127.753918
   Station Elevation (m): 10.0
   Instrument: Acme Strong Motion Sensor
   Serial Number: 123456
   Units: cm/s^2
   Structure Type: Free field sensor
   Channel 1 Horizontal Orientation: 0
   Channel 2 Horizontal Orientation: 90
   Channel 3 Horizontal Orientation: 0
   Vertical Channel: 3
   Samples: 10
   Record Start Time: 2019-05-01 12:34:56.010
   Sampling Rate (Hz): 100
      0.001     0.011     0.021
      0.002     0.012     0.022
      0.003     0.013     0.023
      0.004     0.014     0.024
      0.005     0.015     0.025
      0.006     0.016     0.026
      0.007     0.017     0.027
      0.008     0.018     0.028
      0.009     0.019     0.029
      0.010     0.020     0.030


**The Code**

The sample module below has been tested with the above data, and can be used as
a template for writing a data reader for a new format. This data format is (as
it's name implies) complete in terms of the information required to construct a
``StationStream`` object. Real-world formats may not be as complete. The bare 
minimum information needed to construct a ``StationStream`` of minimal use 
includes:

- Station code
- Station horizontal coordinates
- Some indication of the input units
- Sampling rate or sampling interval
- Distinction between horizontal and vertical channels
- Either a channel orientation (0-360) or some indication of what is E-W and N-S

Record start time is **strongly** desired, but a "NaN" record start time value 
of 1970-01-01 00:00:00 will be inserted by ObsPy if not supplied.

The code below contains comments that should be useful as guides when writing
your own reader. A finished reader with tests and data should be organized as 
below.

Assumptions: The event ID associated with this record is **csabcd1234**.

- gmprocess->io->complete->core.py (the code below)
- tests->gmprocess->io->complete->complete_test.py (test code for core.py)
- gmprocess->data->testdata->complete->csabcd1234->complete.dat (at least one 
  example of the file format)
- gmprocess->data->testdata->complete->event.json->event.json (JSON file 
  containing basic event information):
