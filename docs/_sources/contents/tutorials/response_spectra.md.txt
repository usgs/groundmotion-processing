# Response Spectra Calculation and Comparison

In this tutorial we will read in an example record, compute the response
spectra, and compare it to a ground motion prediction equation.


There are a lot of imports to take care of first

```{code-cell} ipython3
import os

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import _cm as cm
import numpy as np

# OpenQuake imports for GMPEs
from openquake.hazardlib.gsim import base
import openquake.hazardlib.imt as imt
from openquake.hazardlib.const import StdDev
from openquake.hazardlib.gsim.boore_2014 import BooreEtAl2014

from gmprocess.core.streamcollection import StreamCollection
from gmprocess.utils.config import get_config
from gmprocess.waveform_processing.processing import process_streams
from gmprocess.utils.event import get_event_object
from gmprocess.utils.constants import DATA_DIR
from gmprocess.metrics.station_summary import StationSummary
```

Now we will read in some records from we keep in the repository for testing
purposes, get the config file that controls many of the processing steps,
and the event object for this earthquake

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-stderr]
# Path to example data
datadir = DATA_DIR / 'testdata' / 'demo' / 'ci38457511'/ 'raw'
sc = StreamCollection.from_directory(datadir)
sc.describe()
```

You can see from the output that this test dataset includes 3 StationStreams, 
each with 3 StationTraces. All of the streams are labeled as "passed"
because we have not yet subjected them to the QA tests.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Get the default config file
conf = get_config()

# Get event object
event = get_event_object('ci38457511')
print(event)
```

The next step is to processing the streams and then compute a
"StationSummary" instance, which holds the station and waveform
metrics, including the response spectra

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-stderr]
# Process the straems
psc = process_streams(sc, event, conf)
psc.describe()
```

From the `describe` output, you can see that none of the stations failed
the QA checks that are applied during the `process_streams` command. 

We now compute the response spectral with the StationSummary class for 
the third stream (CI.CCC)

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Compute response spectra for one of the processed streams
summary = StationSummary.from_config(psc[2], event=event, config=conf)
print(summary.pgms)
```

The `pgms` attribute is a Pandas dataframe, indexed by the IMTs and IMCs. 

```{note} The "pgm" abbreviation used is this code was originally for 
"peak ground motions". But it now includes ground motion metrics that are
not related to "peaks" in any way (such as duration). So "pgm" may
be better, although more awkwardly, treated as an abbreviation for 
"property of ground motion."
```

We can also get a dictionary that includes the response spectra for a specific
IMC

```{code-cell} ipython3
rotd_dict = summary.get_imc_dict('ROTD(50.0)')
```

But a more convenient format for plotting is to get the spectral accelerations
and oscillator periods as arrays

```{code-cell} ipython3
sa_arrays = summary.get_sa_arrays('ROTD(50.0)')
period = sa_arrays['ROTD(50.0)']['period']
sa = sa_arrays['ROTD(50.0)']['sa']

# Note on units: OQ uses natural log of g, gmprocess uses %g
sa_g = sa / 100.0
```

Now we will compute the response spectra from a GMPE

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Prepare inputs for OQ GMPE
gmpe = BooreEtAl2014()
stddev_types = [StdDev.TOTAL]

# Define rupture information
inputs = base.RuptureContext()
inputs.mag = rotd_dict['ROTD(50.0)']['EarthquakeMagnitude']
inputs.rake = 90.0
inputs.hypo_depth = rotd_dict['ROTD(50.0)']['EarthquakeDepth']
inputs.ztor = 0.0
inputs.rjb = np.array([5.0])
inputs.rrup = np.array([5.0])
inputs.vs30 = np.array([760.0])
inputs.sids = np.array([0])

# Evaluate (must loop over periods since OQ takes in IMT as scalar)
BSSA14 = {
    'lmean': np.array([]),
    'lsd': np.array([])
}
for per in period:
    lmean, lsd = gmpe.get_mean_and_stddevs(
        inputs, inputs, inputs, imt.SA(per), stddev_types)
    BSSA14['lmean'] = np.append(BSSA14['lmean'], lmean[0])
    BSSA14['lsd'] = np.append(BSSA14['lsd'], lsd[0][0])
```

Lastly, we construct the plot

```{code-cell} ipython3
gmpe_mean = np.exp(BSSA14['lmean'])
gmpe_upper = np.exp(BSSA14['lmean'] + BSSA14['lsd'])
gmpe_lower = np.exp(BSSA14['lmean'] - BSSA14['lsd'])
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_axes([0.125, 0.125, 0.825, 0.825])
ax.fill_between(period, gmpe_lower, gmpe_upper, fc='k', alpha=0.25)
ax.loglog(period, gmpe_mean, color='k', lw=2, label='BSSA14')
ax.loglog(period, sa_g, color=(0.0, 0.4, 0.8), lw=2, marker='o',
          label=psc[2].id)
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel('Period (sec)')
ax.set_ylabel('Spectral Acceleration (g)');
```
