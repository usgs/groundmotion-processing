.. py:function:: directory_to_streams(directory, config=None)

   Read in a directory of data to a list of streams.

   Note:
   If the directory only includes files that are readable by this library
   then the task is rather simple. However, often times data directories
   include random subdirectories and/or zip files, which we try to crawl in
   a sensible fashion.

   :param directory: Directory of ground motion files (streams).
   :type directory: str
   :param config: Configuration options.
   :type config: dict

   :returns:

             (List of obspy streams,
                     List of unprocessed files,
                     List of errors associated with trying to read unprocessed
                     files).
   :rtype: tuple
