.. py:function:: directory_to_dataframe(directory, imcs=None, imts=None, origin=None, process=True)

   Extract peak ground motions from list of Stream objects.
   Note: The PGM columns underneath each channel will be variable
   depending on the units of the Stream being passed in (velocity
   sensors can only generate PGV) and on the imtlist passed in by
   user. Spectral acceleration columns will be formatted as SA(0.3)
   for 0.3 second spectral acceleration, for example.

   :param directory: Directory of ground motion files (streams).
   :type directory: str
   :param imcs: Strings designating desired components to create
                in table.
   :type imcs: list
   :param imts: Strings designating desired PGMs to create
                in table.
   :type imts: list
   :param origin: Defines the focal time and
                  geographical location of an earthquake hypocenter.
                  Default is None.
   :type origin: obspy.core.event.Origin
   :param process: Process the stream using the config file.
   :type process: bool
