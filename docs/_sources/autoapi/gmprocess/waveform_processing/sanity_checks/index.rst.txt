.. py:function:: check_tail(st, duration, max_vel_ratio=0.1, max_dis_ratio=0.5)

   Check for abnormally arge values in the tail of the stream.

   This QA check looks for the presence of abnomally large values in the tail
   velocity and displacement traces. This can occur due to baseline shifts or
   long period noise that has not been properly filtered out that manifest
   as long-period drifts in the velocity and/or displacement traces.

   Note that an additional problem that this check should eliminate is records
   in which the time window has not captured the full duration of shaking.

   :param st: StationStream object.
   :type st: StationStream
   :param duration: Duration of tail.
   :type duration: float
   :param max_vel_ratio: Trace is labeled as failed if the max absolute velocity in the tail
                         is greater than max_vel_ratio times the max absolute velocity of
                         the whole trace.
   :type max_vel_ratio: float
   :param max_dis_ratio: Trace is labeled as failed if the max absolute displacement in the
                         tail is greater than max_disp_ratio times the max absolute
                         displacement of the whole trace.
   :type max_dis_ratio: float

   Returns:
