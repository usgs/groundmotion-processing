.. py:function:: pphase_pick(trace, period=None, damping=0.6, nbins=None, peak_selection=False)

   Compute P-phase arrival time.

   Adapted from Python code written by Francisco Hernandez of the Puerto Rico
   Strong Motion Program. That code was in turn adapted from Matlab code written by
   Dr. Erol Kalkan, P.E. The algorithms are described here in full:

   Kalkan, E. (2016). "An automatic P-phase arrival time picker", Bull. of
   Seismol. Soc. of Am., 106, No. 3, doi: 10.1785/0120150111

   :param trace: StationTrace containing waveform (acceleration or velocity) data.
   :type trace: StationTrace
   :param period: Undamped natural period of the sensor in seconds. Defaults to 0.01s for
                  sample rates >= 100, 0.1s for sample rates < 100.
   :type period: float
   :param damping: Damping ratio.
   :type damping: float
   :param nbins: Histogram bin size (default is 2/sampling interval). Regional or
                 teleseismic records may need different values of bin size for better
                 picking results)
   :type nbins: int
   :param selection:
                     One of:
                         Selector.TO_PEAK - take segment of waveform from beginning to absolute
                             peak value (recommended for fast processing).
                         Selector.FULL - take full waveform.
   :type selection: Selector

   :returns:     - Float number of seconds from start of trace to P-Phase beginning.
                 - Signal-to-noise ratio in decibels
   :rtype: tuple


.. py:function:: _get_statelevel(y, n)


.. py:function:: create_travel_time_dataframe(streams, catalog_file, ddepth, ddist, model)

   Creates a travel time dataframe, which contains the phase arrrival times
   for each station the StreamCollection, for each event in the catalog.
   This uses an interpolation method to save time, and the fineness of the
   interpolation grid can be adjusted using the ddepth and ddist parameters.
   Using the recommended values of ddepth=5 and ddist=0.1 are generally
   sufficient to achieve less than 0.1 seconds of error in the travel times,
   for most cases.

   :param streams: Streams to calculate travel times for.
   :type streams: StreamCollection
   :param catalog_file: The path to the CSV file (from ComCat) which contains event info.
   :type catalog_file: str
   :param ddepth: The depth spacing (in km) for the interpolation grid.
                  Recommended value is 5 km.
   :type ddepth: float
   :param ddist: The distance spacing (in decimal degrees) for the interpolation
                 grid. Recommend value is 0.1 degrees.
   :type ddist: float

   Retuns:
       A tuple, containing the travel time dataframe and the catalog
       (list of ScalarEvent objects).
