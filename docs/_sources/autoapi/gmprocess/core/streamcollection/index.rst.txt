.. py:module:: gmprocess.core.streamcollection

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Module for StreamCollection class.

   This class functions as a list of StationStream objects, and enforces
   various rules, such as all traces within a stream are from the same station.

   Bases: :py:obj:`gmprocess.core.streamarray.StreamArray`

   A collection/list of StationStream objects.

   This is a list of StationStream objects, where the constituent
   StationTraces are grouped such that:

       - All traces are from the same network/station/instrument.
       - Sample rates must match.
       - Units much match.

   .. todo::

      - Check for and handle misaligned start times and end times.
      - Check units

   .. py:method:: validate()

      Some validation checks across streams.


   .. py:method:: select_colocated(preference=['HN?', 'BN?', 'HH?', 'BH?'], large_dist=None, origin=None)

      Detect colocated instruments, return preferred instrument type.

      This uses the list of the first two channel characters, given as
      'preference' in the 'colocated' section of the config. The algorithm
      is:

          1) Generate list of StationStreams that have the same station code.
          2) For each colocated group, loop over the list of preferred
             instrument codes, select the first one that is encountered by
             labeling all others a failed.

              * If the preferred instrument type matches more than one
                StationStream, pick the first (hopefully this never happens).
              * If no StationStream matches any of the codes in the preferred
                list then label all as failed.

      :param preference: List of strings indicating preferred instrument types.
      :type preference: list
      :param large_dist: A dictionary with keys "preference", "mag", and "dist";
                         "preference" is the same as the "preference" argument to this
                         function, but will replace it when the distance is exceeded
                         for a given magnitude. The distance threshold is computed as:

                             ```
                             dist_thresh = dist[0]
                             for m, d in zip(mag, dist):
                                 if eqmag > m:
                                     dist_thresh = d
                             ```
      :type large_dist: dict

   .. py:method:: to_dataframe(origin, imcs=None, imts=None)

      Get a summary dataframe of streams.

      Note: The PGM columns underneath each channel will be variable
      depending on the units of the Stream being passed in (velocity
      sensors can only generate PGV) and on the imtlist passed in by
      user. Spectral acceleration columns will be formatted as SA(0.3)
      for 0.3 second spectral acceleration, for example.
