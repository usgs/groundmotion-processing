.. py:function:: setup_logger(args=None, level='info', log_file=None)

   Setup the logger options.

   This is written to handle a few different situations. It is called by
   command line programs that will hand off the args object. However, it
   may also be used for interactive sessions/notebooks where we want to
   suppress warnings, especially those from dependencies that are out of
   our control. For this, the args object is not available and will be None,
   and we then control the logging verbosity with the level argument (only
   used if args is None).

   :param args: Must contain logging options in gmprocess.args.add_shared_args.
   :type args: argparse
   :param level: String indicating logging level; either 'info', 'debug', or
                 'error'. Only used if args in None.
   :type level: str
   :param log_file: Path to send logging to.
   :type log_file: str
