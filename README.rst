Introduction
------------
This is a project designed to provide a number of functions related to parsing
and processing earthquake ground motion data, building on top of the 
`ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`_
library. Most of the extensions that we provide are to handle strong motion
data and related issues.


Documentation
-------------
- Please note, we are in the process of improving the documentation and that
  there are some incomplete sections.
- The full documentation is available
  `here <https://usgs.github.io/groundmotion-processing/index.html>`_.
