Contributing Guidelines
=======================

We welcome contributions to this project from anyone in the community. There
are a few guidelines that we try to follow to ensure consistency and quality
of the code. The big picture rules are: 

- Submit changes via a pull request from a feature branch.

- Before working on changes, it is best to talk to us first. This is best
  accomplished by opening an 
  `issue <https://github.com/usgs/groundmotion-processing/issues>`_
  on Github and describing the what you are planning to accomplish.

- If you add new code, be sure to add unit tests for the new code.

- We generally try to follow `pep8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
  as much as possible.

- Please include doc strings for all public methods. We use the 
  `"Google" <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
  doc string style.

- Run the unit tests (we use ``pytest``) prior to sending in your changes.

- Run a linter such as `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ 
  or an auto formatter like `autopep8 <https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/>`_.
  before sending in your changes.

- Use Python's 
  `built-in <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions>`_
  exceptions as much as possible.
