# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions to this project from anyone in the community. There
are a few guidelines that we try to follow to ensure consistency and quality
of the code. The big picture rules are: 

- Submit changes via a pull request from a feature branch and see the [Merge Requests](merge_requests) section.

- Before working on changes, it is best to talk to us first. This is best
  accomplished by opening an 
  [issue](https://github.com/usgs/groundmotion-processing/issues)
  on Github and describing the what you are planning to accomplish.

- We generally try to follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  as much as possible.

- Please include doc strings for all public methods. We use the 
  [Google](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
  doc string style.

- Please use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format python code.

- Use Python's 
  [built-in](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions)
  exceptions as much as possible.
